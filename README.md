**CI/CD Pipeline**


In this project I worked on building by own jenkins pipeline to test and deploy a a simple web app hosted in AWS.
I used s3 to deploy a static website using configuarations on a jenkins file.
I used Cloud Formation to provision a stable environment for the app to be hosted on. The ec2 instance provided by the Cloud Formation, 
Then had Jenkins installed and Java installed unto it. 
This project allowed me to follow an effective process of provisioning various tools and services to in a seamless way. 
Automation was at the core of the process with tools such as Github Webhooks and Jenkins triggers being enabled.
Finally, I utilise AWS Lambda to a link a funtion to the web app.
